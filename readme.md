### hello stranger!

I am a contractor/freelance software engineer with big data, ML and MLOps experience</h3>

<br>

<details>
  <summary><b>about me</b></summary>

I am experienced in designing and building backend, big data and machine learning (ML) solutions

I have been professionally developing software since 2007. I hold a BSc in Statistics and MSc in Computer Science

I have built systems using Java, Scala, Groovy, Kotlin, and Python. I am experienced in object-oriented programming, functional programming, test-driven development, multi-paradigm languages

I have hands on experience in distributed computing environments and computing at scale (e.g. hadoop, nosql, cloud computing). I completed projects using AWS, GCP, Azure and PCF. I am comfortable with DevOps activities

I can fulfil roles of Senior Engineer or Tech Lead within a team/organization

I am a lifelong learner. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and mentoring

My interests are (I spend time thinking about):
* Fact based decisions
* Data intensive applications
* Bringing ML models to production, MLOps and overall how we could improve tooling/practices around ML projects

Some values/perspectives I have:
* I am not religious or obsessed about any platform/language/tool. They are all good when used in the right context. I care about problems and domains. 
* For me people and organization culture are more important than tech & tools. 
* I am a fan of Richard Feynman. As a result I am against cargo cult science (or development)
* I get more satisfaction by deleting code rather than writing it. 

Then you may ask why are you here at all? Well...
